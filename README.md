# Photo-Sharing-App

An app to upload photos to share with friends.

## Description

This is full stack MERN project where you can add friends, upload photos, and like other users posts.

the goal of this app was to test my knowledge of full stack dev and see where my weaknesses are that need more work

## How to install

you need to run the server and client locally. both folders have a read me on how to get each part up and running.

## How To Use

Once you have the app running, all you need to do is sign up for an account and start posting

## What I learned

### Formik and yup for validation and form handling

I've mostly used vanilla javascript Form so it was nice seeing a more robust library to help with strongly typed objects for form validation and uploading

### Drag and drop multiform data and upload

At this point I've mostly worked with uploading JSON data in my MERN apps. Seeing how to use and style a drag and drop component then sending multiform data to my server was helpful.

### More exposure to Material UI

this app helped me reinfornce Material UI concepts and best practices such as global themes and useMedia query

### More exposure to Redux

## Features

### User Login

### Front Page

### Profile Page

## Credits

This app was based on the [Fullstack MERN app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o) from [EdRoh's](https://www.youtube.com/@EdRohDev) youtube channel.

Although this project gave me more insight on full stack development. I would not reccommend it for learning.
